# Capstone-Project---Databases
Java OOP project that utilises a database, JDBC and SQL for queries.

The project is a project management system for a structural engineering firm called "Poised". It is a java program that the firm can use to capture 
information about new projects, update information about existing projects, finalise existing projects (generate an invoice for the client and mark it as finalised
with the completion date), be able to see a list of projects that still need to be completed/that are past their due date, and be able to find and select a project
by entering either the project number or project name.

The user is given options, and needs to supply input in order to navigate the menu system and to run the required functions.

This project extends the previous Capstone project by making use of a database instead of text files to store the data to be used for the program. SQL queries are executed through JDBC statements in order to interact with the database. The database and its tables are created by way of MySQL.
